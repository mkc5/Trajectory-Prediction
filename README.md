# Exploring-Trajectory-Prediction-Through-Deep-Learning-Methods

The project is trajectory predictions, the prediction of the subject's next location is helpful in many ways. So Microsoft has initiated this project using china's data. We worked on the prediction of multiple subjects as an extension for predictions of a single subject. This project was based on Microsoft geolife project which was the base reference for this project.
